## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `bun install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `bun dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `bun build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `bun preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `bun astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `bun astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |

## 💬 Chat assistant

The chat widget streams answers from Gemini through TanStack AI (`src/pages/api/chat.ts`) and runs on Cloudflare Workers.

- Local key: copy `.dev.vars.example` to `.dev.vars` and fill in `GEMINI_API_KEY`, then restart `bun dev`.
- Production key: `bunx wrangler secret put GEMINI_API_KEY`.
- Deploy: `bun run build && bunx wrangler deploy`.
- The assistant only answers from `src/data/profile.ts` (prompt in `src/lib/chat-prompt.ts`).
- Limits: 10 requests per minute per IP (`ratelimits` in `wrangler.jsonc`), 500 characters per message and 12 questions per conversation (`src/lib/chat.ts`).
